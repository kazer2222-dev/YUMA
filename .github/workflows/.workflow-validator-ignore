# GitHub Actions Workflow Validator Ignore File
# 
# The linter shows "Unable to resolve action" errors for standard GitHub Actions.
# These are false positives - the actions exist and are valid:
# - actions/checkout@v4
# - actions/setup-node@v4
# - actions/upload-artifact@v4
# - github/codeql-action/init@v3
# - github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3
# - github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
#
# These workflows will work correctly when pushed to GitHub.
# The warnings about secrets context access are expected and normal.
